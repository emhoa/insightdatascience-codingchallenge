This program fully implements the first feature of the coding challenge, namely to clean "tweets.txt" of Unicode and escape characters, outputing the result into tweet_output/ft1.txt
Unfortunately, the second feature is not operational. I ran out of time and had a segmentation fault I was still debugging.
